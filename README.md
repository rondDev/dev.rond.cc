# dev.rond.cc

This website and repository serves as a sort of playground of technology.
I don't take this repo or website too serious and it's just made for fun.

Feel free to use it for yourself (both the repo and website), but don't
expect it to be "production-ready". It is a hobby project and should be treated
as such. If you come to depend on it, please fork it and make a stable version
for yourself, license should permit that.

## Contribute

If you somehow want to contribute, feel free, as of now I don't have any
guidelines or templates for submissions. Anyone who does want to contribute,
but with ideas instead of code, feel free to open an issue with a feature
request, they are always welcome!

If you for some reason need to contact me, the best way would be to join my
[discord server](https://rond.cc/discord) and dm me!
